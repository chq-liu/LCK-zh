# 音韻 

非語言學家的造語常從字母表開始，他們喜歡在基本拉丁字母的基礎上加上一些奇怪的變音符。這樣做會使他們的字母表看與英語無異，還充斥這連作者都不會發的冗餘發音。

你對語音學（phonetic／研究人類可發出的音）和音系學（phonology／研究語音在語言中的使用）的瞭解得越多，你的造語之路就會越通暢。

除本書外，若你只想讀一本關於語音學的書，推薦的選擇是 J.C. Catford 的 *A Practical Introduction to Phonetics*。此書系統性的介紹了人類可發的所有聲音，並對如何發音——即使是在沒聽過時——進行了實用的描述。

語言學家用音素（phone）來指代語言中使用的特定聲音。

## 標音法

語言教科書中常常透過與英語的比較和對特殊發音技巧的講述來描述發音，而語言學家們則使用 IPA（國際音標）——一套具有精確含義的符號——來表述發音。

在上文我並未使用 IPA，因爲瞭解語音學之前，它並太大用處。現在 IPA 符號將置於方括號中展示，而那些慣用的習慣的英文拼寫則會用粗體字表示。例如 **sh**[ʃ] 指的是英語中諸如 *shirt* 之類單詞裏的 **sh** 音，而代表它音標是 ʃ。

當音標的寫法與英語寫法一致時，不標出音標，例如 **f** 的音標是 [f]。本書後附國際音標表以供參考。

## 子音

大多數人能區分母音和子音，儘管它們的區別並不似一般語言學習中強調的那麼大。但子音仍可進一步分類，而最重要的劃分是發音部位和發音方式（發音時形成和克服阻礙的方式）的二維區分。

### 發音部位

絕大多數子音是由肺部氣流受阻形成的，所以子音的第一個特徵就是阻礙發生的位置，讓我們從嘴脣開始向內移動。

![4-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thesyiya/conlang_tool/master/BOOK/LCK/resource/4-1.png)

- 脣（雙脣音）：阻礙部分僅嘴脣（**w**）
- 脣齒（脣齒音）：脣和齒接觸（**f, v**）
- 齒（舌尖—齒音）：舌尖抵住牙齒（**th**：清音 [θ]、濁音 [ð]，法語和西班牙語的  **t, d**）
- 齒齦（舌尖—齒齦音）：舌尖和上齒齦或上齒背接觸（**s, z**，英語的 **t, d**，西班牙語的 **r**）
- 齦後（舌葉—齒齦後音）：舌葉和齒齦接觸 (**sh** [ʃ]，美式英語的 **r** [ɹ]）
- 硬齶（中舌面—後硬齶音）：舌面中部和硬齶後部接觸（西班牙語的 **ñ** [ɲ]，義大利語的 **gn**，梵語的 **c**）
- 軟齶（後舌面—軟齶音）：舌面後部與軟齶（一般在前部，即軟硬齶交界處）接觸（**k, g, ng** [ŋ]）
- 小舌（舌根前—小舌音）：舌根前部和小舌接觸，接觸點一般在舌根舌面交界處（阿拉伯語的 **q**，法語的 **r**）。爲發出小舌音 **q**，你可以發軟齶音 **k**，同時將舌儘量後移。你會發現兩者音調的不同，**q** 比 **k** 音調更低。*milk* 中的 k 一定程度上是小舌音（比較 *Mick* 中的 k）
- 聲門／喉音（舌根—喉壁音）：喉部緊縮形成（**h**，披頭四的約翰・藍儂發 *bottle* 時會發出喉塞音 [ʔ]）

因爲拉丁字母的字符數限制，自然語言會模糊地使用字母，或是附加變音符號來記錄發音。比如英語和法語的 **t** 不是同一個音。法語的 **t** 是舌尖抵住牙齒形成的，而英語的 **t** 是舌尖和上齒齦或上齒背接觸形成的。

### 發音方法

子音會因爲發音時形成和克服阻礙的方式的不同而產生差異，這種差異形成了發音方式的不同（發音時形成和克服阻礙的方式）

- 塞音（也叫爆發音） stop it entirely: **p t k b d g**. In the middle of a word, as in **happy**, this is so fast that we’re hardly conscious of the closure. The stop can be lengthened, however, and then we can see there’s actually a brief silence while the airflow is stopped. Compare *back kit, Beckett*. 
- Fricatives just impede the airflow, creating a noticeable hissing sound: **f s sh** [ʃ] **kh** [x]. A fricative can be prolonged indefinitely. 
- Affricates consist of a stop releasing into a fricative at the same place of articulation, such as **t + s** in *tsetse*. English **ch** is actually an affricate, consisting of **t + sh** [tʃ]; likewise **j** is **d + zh** [dʒ]. 
- approximantS impede the airflow only slightly; there’s no hissing sound, only a slight change in sound quality: **r l w y**. Confusingly, the IPA for **y** is [j]. Don’t mistake this for English **j**. 
- If the airflow isn’t obstructed at all, what you have is a vowel. 

### More distinctions

#### 清濁

子音區分清濁Consonants can be voiced or unvoiced; voicing just means letting the vocal cords vibrate. 

Unvoiced and voiced consonants usually come in pairs: **p/b, t/d, k/g, f/v, sh/zh**, and so on. Sometimes there are gaps: 

- German has unvoiced **kh** [x] (which it spells **ch**) but not voiced **gh** [ɣ] (which however exists in Dutch). 
- Spanish has unvoiced **s** but not voiced **z**. 
- Standard Arabic has voiced **b** but not unvoiced **p**. 
- Often approximants only appear in voiced form. Nonetheless it’s possible to have an unvoiced **r l w y**. For some English speakers, *wh* is pronounced as an unvoiced **w**[w]. 

Vowels are normally voiced; we’ll see some exceptions later. 

Voicing isn’t entirely binary; languages can differ in voicing onset time (VOT), which is when the voicing starts. English has relatively late VOT— we start voicing initial **b, d, g, j** pretty late; French, by contrast, has early VOT. English also tends to stop voicing pretty early if the consonant ends a word. 

We really distinguish “voiced” consonants at the beginning and end of the word by other cues. 

**Nasalization** 

Instead of simply stopping the airflow, we can re-route it through the nose, producing nasal consonants: 

**m n ng** [ŋ]. 

The mouth does the exact thing for **b** as for **m**; the difference is that the nasal passage is open for **m**. 

Thus we call **m** a nasal stop, or just a nasal, with a labial place of articulation. 

Similarly, **n** is a nasal dental or dental-alveolar, and **ng** [ŋ] is a nasal velar. If a language has other 

places of articulation, it can have other nasals, e.g. labiodental [ɱ], palatal [ɲ]. 

**Aspiration** 

Stops may be released lightly, or with a noticeable puff of air— ASPIRATION. In English, we aspirate 

unvoiced stops at the beginning of a word (**pot, tall, cow)**, but not after an **s** (**spot, stall, scow**). French 

and Spanish doesn’t have this initial aspiration (and if you retain it while speaking these languages 

you’ll have a gringo accent). 

In Chinese, Hindi, or (Cusco) Quechua, there are separate series of aspirated and unaspirated stops. In 

Chinese and Quechua, in fact, there isn’t a series of voiced stops at all. **Beijing**, for instance, doesn’t 

start with a **b** at all, but an unaspirated **p**. 

The IPA symbol is [ʰ]; so the Chinese labial stops are [p pʰ]. 

**Palatalization** 

A PALATALIZED consonant is pronounced by raising the tongue toward the top of the mouth. This 

happens to be about the position for **y**, and a palatalized consonant may sound to an English speaker as 

if there’s a **y** (IPA [j]) after or before it. 

Russian and Gaelic have palatalized and unpalatalized versions of most of their consonants. For 

instance, да, да [da da] ‘yes, yes’ sounds very different from дядя [dʲadʲə] ‘uncle’. 

Palatalization is an example of co-articulation: the consonant is pronounced at (or nearly at) its normal 

place of articulation, but with the tongue raised. So palatalized [nʲ] isn’t quite the same as palatal [ɲ].**Labialization** 

A LABIALIZED consonant is pronounced with the lips rounded. For instance, Latin **aqua** ‘water’ was 

pronounced [akʷa] with labialized k. This isn’t the same as the cluster [kw]; with true labialized [kʷ], 

the lip-rounding is **simultaneous** with the [k]. 

Any of the stops can be labialized, and fricatives too. 

**Glottal games** 

Most sounds are produced by air moving from the lungs. It’s also possible to create a small amount of 

airflow by moving the larynx up or down, without any pulmonic airflow at all. 

Try it! Touch your Adam’s apple and sing an [a], varying from high to low pitch; you’ll feel the 

larynx moving. Now do it silently. Finally, keep the vocal cords closed as for [ʔ], put the tongue in [k] 

position, and raise the larynx suddenly— that should produce an EJECTIVE [k’], a sort of throaty puff. 

Now keep your lips closed as for [b], and move the larynx **down** while voicing; this should produce a 

strangled-sounding [ɓ], an IMPLOSIVE. There’s also implosives [ɗ] and [ɠ]. 

**The consonant grid** 

Where non-linguists tend to list sounds in alphabetical order, linguists prefer to use a PHONOLOGICAL 

GRID, with place of articulation across the top, and degree of closure down the sides. 

The grid for American English looks like this. 

Voicing is a third dimension in English; voiced sounds can simply be placed next to the unvoiced 

equivalent. 

This is where the **p t k** order comes from: the stops are listed in order of place of articulation. 

**Rhotics** 

In programming, there’s an aphorism that 10% of the functionality takes 90% of the effort. In 

phonetics we might say the same about **r** and **l**, which are quite messy. 

There are a number of RHOTIC (**r**) sounds: 

• American **r** [ɹ] is an approximant, but there are two ways of forming it (which sound about the 

same): 

° A RETROFLEX **r** [ɻ] is pronounced by curling the tongue up behind the alveolar ridge. Some 

languages, such as Hindi, have a series of retroflex consonants, such as the stops [ʈ] and [ɖ]. 

° A BUNCHED **r** is pronounced by bunching up the tongue thickly under the palate; the tip is drawn 

back into the body of the tongue. 

• In much of England **r** is a post-alveolar approximant— like the retroflex **r** but the tongue 

pointed at the alveolar ridge, not curled back. (However, younger speakers seem to be 

adopting a sound more like a w!)• Another type of **r** is a TAP [ɾ], where the tongue tip is brushed briefly against the alveolar ridge. 

This can sound like a **d**; thus “veddy” for “very” in attempts to capture certain accents. 

Spanish single, non-initial **r** (as in **caro**) is a tap; it’s also common in Scottish English. 

• **R** can be TRILLED [r], which is like a repeated tap caused by vibrating the tongue against the 

alveolar ridge. Initial and double **r** in Spanish are trilled (as in **rueda, carro)**. 

• French **r** is a uvular approximant or trill [ʀ]. 

Don’t confuse any of these realizations with a **dropped** **r**— that is, one that’s not there! Many English 

dialects are NON-RHOTIC, meaning that syllable-final **r** is dropped. 

**Laterals** 

LATERALS (**l** sounds) are so called because they’re made with a closure, like a stop, but leaving an 

opening at the sides of the tongue for airflow. 

• English has two distinct **l** sounds: 

° CLEAR **l** is formed with the closure on the alveolar ridge; it occurs at the beginning of a syllable, 

as in **Luke**. 

° DARK **l** [ɫ] is formed by retracting the tongue (velarization); it occurs at the end of a syllable, as in 

**cool.** Velarization can be applied to other consonants as well. 

Many languages have a clear **l** in all positions; using a dark **l** in (say) Spanish will mark you as an 

**anglófono**. 

• Russian (among other languages) has a **dental** **l**, with the tongue touching the teeth. If you want 

a Slavic accent, make your **l**’s dental. 

• Then there’s palatal **l** [ʎ], as in Italian **voglio**. Spanish **ll** used to be pronounced this way, and 

still is in some dialects. 

• If the edges of the tongue are closer to the sides of the mouth, so that there’s a noticeable 

hissing sound, you have a LATERAL FRICATIVE [ɮ]. Welsh **ll** is an **unvoiced** lateral fricative [ɬ]. 

(You may pause to congratulate yourself that you can now work out a triple-barreled term like 

that. If you can’t, re-read the consonants section!) 

**Phones, phonemes, and allophones** 

I’ve talked about (say) different realizations of English **l** or **p**. However, we need to be more precise 

about what this means. 

Each language has a set of PHONEMES— classes of sounds (phones) that speakers treat as “the same 

sound”. By convention, 

• **phonemes** appear between **slashes**: /l/, /p/... 

• **phones** appear between **brackets**: [l], [p]... 

This allows us to be brief and precise. For instance, we say that English /p/ is realized as [pʰ] initially 

and as [p] elsewhere. (The absence of the ʰ indicates a lack of aspiration.) The two phones [pʰ] and [p] 

are called ALLOPHONES of /p/. 

You can think of phonemes as how sounds are represented in the speaker’s mental grammar. Speakers 

are often quite unaware of allophonic variation. We don’t think of the **p** in **pot** and **spot** as different, 

though phonetically they are. 

**Phonemes vs. letters** 

Often phonemes correspond to letters, but don’t confuse them; letters are an aspect of writing systems,which are a separate topic. The same language may have multiple writing systems— e.g. Yiddish can 

be written in Hebrew or Roman letters; Turkish was once written in Arabic script and now uses 

Roman; Mandarin can be written using Chinese characters or in a dizzying variety of romanizations. 

Letters don’t correspond one-for-one with phonemes— notoriously so, in English. Digraphs like **ch** 

represent a single phoneme /č/. A letter can represent different phonemes; e.g. **s** can represent /s/, /z/, 

or /š/. And a single phoneme may be spelled in many ways: e.g. English /f/ can be spelled **f** or **ph**. 

Phonemes may be written using IPA, but often this isn’t very convenient. For a conlang, you can think 

of the phonemes as your romanization scheme— for most purposes, your writing system. If you like **š** 

better than **ʃ**, by all means use it for the phoneme. 

***** ***But I’m !* 

**Maybe you’ve been making conlangs since you were eight and you use a lot of personal symbols.** 

**Well, knock it off.** 

**Once your conlang leaves your desk, you need to make it accessible to other people. Even if you** 

**carefully explain that % means [ʃ], they’ll forget or won’t care.** 

**Plus, all those cool symbols you found buried in the Unicode manual have some actual meaning,** 

**and the people who know that meaning will just be confused when you misapply them.** 

**Phonemes vs. allophones** 

Here are some more examples of phones vs. allophones: 

• English /t/ is [tʰ] initially, [t] after an [s], often an unreleased [tˀ] finally, and often a glottal stop 

[ʔ] medially (as in **button**). 

• English /l/ is clear [l] initially, dark [ɫ] finally. 

• English /m/ is usually labial, but it’s labiodental [ɱ] before [f]. 

• In some English dialects, dropped final /r/ reappears before a vowel: **I fear a disaster** = [aj fir ə 

dɪzɑstə]. In this case we may say that there’s still an underlying phoneme /r/, but it’s normally 

realized as [ə], and only as [r] before a vowel. But for some speakers, an [r] is added between 

vowels whether or not written English has an **r**: e.g. **I saw a cat** = [aj sɔr ə kæt]. For them, this 

intrusive r isn’t a phoneme at all. 

• Spanish /s/ is usually [s], but it’s voiced [z] before a voiced consonant: **los dedos** = [loz deðos]. 

**Allophones vs. dialectal realizations** 

Don’t confuse allophones with dialectal variation. Allophones exist within a **single speaker’s** dialect. 

For instance, the different ways different English varieties pronounce /r/ are not allophonic. Each 

individual has a particular REALIZATION they always use— e.g. a Scottish speaker always has /r/ as 

flapped [ɾ]. 

Different dialects can have different phonemes. For instance, European Spanish has a /θ/ phoneme; in 

Latin American Spanish it’s merged with /s/. Some English dialects have a separate unvoiced /w/ for 

**wh**; others just merge this with /w/. 

**Phonemic analysis** 

Phones are very precise and not controversial: if you see [pʰ] you know we’re talking about an 

unvoiced aspirated labial stop. (Though a few symbols aren’t as precise as they could be; e.g. [t] can 

be used for either a dental or an alveolar stop.) 

Phonemes, however, represent an analysis of the language, and there are often multiple ways to dothis, and it’s not always possible to say that one way is the best. 

For instance, is /č/ a phoneme of English? Native speakers do think of it as a “sound”; they’re often 

surprised to learn that phonetically it’s made of two sounds [t] + [ʃ]. Calling /č/ a phoneme also makes 

some observations about English phonology neater. But we could also analyze it as a cluster /tʃ/. 

How do you know if a given sound is a phoneme or an allophone? The classical test is to find MINIMAL 

PAIRS— e.g. **bat** and **pat** show that /b/ and /p/ are separate phonemes in English. We can’t find minimal 

pairs for [pʰ] in **pat** and [p] in **spat**— they never distinguish words; we say they are in COMPLEMENTARY 

DISTRIBUTION. 

Sometimes a phonological puzzle has no accepted solution. In Mandarin, the palatals **j q** occur only 

before high front vowels; they contrast with three separate series: the dental sibilants **z c**, the 

retroflexes **zh ch**, and the velars **g k**, none of which appear before those vowels. We’d like to say that 

the palatals are allophones of one of the other series, but it’s not clear which one! 

**Cross-language comparisons** 

Strictly speaking, only phones should be compared across languages. For instance, you can say that 

both English and Mandarin have [p] and [pʰ] phones. 

But it’s misleading and confusing to say that they both have /p/ **phonemes**. You can find references to 

/p/ in grammars of both languages, but they don’t mean the same thing. English /p/ has [p] and [pʰ] 

allophones and contrasts with /b/; Mandarin /p/ is always [pʰ] and contrasts with /b/, which is 

normally [p], but may be realized as [b] in unaccented syllables. 

Informally, linguists do talk about (say) how many languages have an /a/. Just don’t take this too 

seriously. Without reading the individual grammars, you don’t know what it means that the language 

has an /a/— what actual realizations it has or doesn’t have. 

Some consonants are more common than others. For instance, virtually all languages have the simple 

stops [p t k]. Lass's **Phonology** gives examples; see also David Crystal's **The Cambridge Encyclopedia** 

**of Language,** p. 165. Online, search for UPSID (the **UCLA Phonological Segment Inventory Database**). 

**Inventing consonants** 

The amateur way of creating consonants it to mix letters— I encountered one conlang with a sound 

“between an **n** and an **m**”. 

You can pick from the many sounds English doesn’t have— e.g. add palatalized **ñ** and a glottal stop **ʔ**. 

But it’s more naturalistic and more interesting to add entire series— or remove them. Cusco Quechua, 

for instance, has three series of stops— aspirated, non-aspirated, and glottalized— but doesn’t 

distinguish voiced and unvoiced stops. 

Or you can add places of articulation. For instance, while English has three series of stops, Hindi has 

five (labial, dental, retroflex, alveolo-palatal, and velar), and Arabic has six (bilabial, dental, 

‘emphatic’ (don’t ask), velar, uvular, glottal). 

**Vowels** 

Vowels vary in several dimensions. The most important are height, frontness, and roundedness. 

**Height**HEIGHT refers to the height of the tongue within the mouth; there’s also a tendency to open the mouth 

wider as the tongue lowers, so lower vowels are also called OPEN. 

The usual scale is HIGH [i, u], MID [e, o], LOW [a]. 

Many languages, including English, have four steps instead. Instead of mid there are two heights: 

• MID-HIGH or CLOSED: English /e, o/ as in **say, so**, French **é** and the [o] in **eau**; the Italian **e**, **o** in 

**cera, voce.** 

• MID-LOW or OPEN: English /ɛ/ as in **set**; French **è** and the **o** in **donner**; Italian **e**, **o** in **sella, cosa**. 

For English speakers who distinguish **Don / Dawn** and **cot / caught**, the open **o** or /ɔ/ is the second 

of these pairs. But if you pronounce these words the same, that’s not an open **o** but an [a]! You 

can produce /ɔ/ by starting with /ɛ/ and retracting the tongue; see **Frontness** below. 

The word **closed** is a mnemonic for closed /o/. The word **open** has open **e** (so don’t think about the **o**, 

which is also closed!). 

**Frontness** 

FRONT vowels are pronounced with the tongue pushed forward, to the front of the mouth. [i e ɛ] as in 

**me, may, meh** are all front vowels. 

BACK vowels are pronounced with the tongue retracted— e.g. [u o ɔ] in **do, doe, dawn**. 

In between are CENTRAL vowels, such as the muddy schwa [ə] found in the unstressed syllables of 

**China, about, photograph**. 

English /a/ as in **pot** may be central, but for some speakers it’s a back vowel /ɑ/. The **a** in **cat** is /æ/, a 

low front vowel. 

**The vowel grid** 

You can arrange the vowels in a grid according to these two dimensions. The bottom of the grid is 

usually drawn shorter because there isn’t as much room for the tongue to maneuver as the mouth 

opens more. 

To get a feel for these distinctions, pronounce the phones in the diagram, moving from top to bottom 

or side to side, and noting where your tongue is and how close it is to the roof of the mouth. 

**Tenseness** 

Once you understand the vowel grid, you can appreciate the distinction of TENSE vs. LAX. Graphically, 

tense vowels lie toward the edges of the diagram; lax vowels are closer to the center. The names refer 

to the fact that the tongue is held more tensely forward or backward in order to produce these sounds. 

The standard vowels used for phonetics, the CARDINAL VOWELS, are as tense as possible. English 

speakers, by contrast, tend to pronounce /u/ and /ɛ/ more centrally than the cardinal vowels. 

Many languages, including English, have tense/lax versions of almost all their vowels. Here’s the full 

diagram for my dialect of American English, using sample words:And using IPA: 

**Roundedness** 

A ROUNDED vowel is pronounced with the lips rounded, like English /u, o/, as opposed to an 

UNROUNDED vowel like /i, e/. 

There’s a strong tendency for front vowels to be unrounded, and back vowels to be rounded, as in 

English, Spanish, or Italian. 

• French **u**, **œ** and German **ü**, **ö** are FRONT ROUNDED vowels. To pronounce **ü**, your lips should be in 

the position for **u**, and your tongue for **i**. Or to put it another way, say [i] and purse your lips. 

The IPA for ü is [y]; don’t confuse this with English **y**. 

• Russian ы and Japanese **u** [ɯ] are BACK UNROUNDED vowels. To pronounce [ɯ], say [u] and 

unpurse your lips. 

Here’s an expanded version of the basic vowel grid showing the IPA symbols for unrounded then 

rounded vowels in each position: 

**Other distinctions** 

Vowels can vary along other dimensions as well: 

• LENGTH: vowels may contrast by length, as in Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Japanese, and Old English. 

Estonian has three degrees of length. 

Length just means that the vowel is pronounced for a longer time. E.g. Latin **pōtus** ‘drunken’ 

[po:tus] contrasts with **potis** ‘able’ [potis]. As a complication, short vowels may be laxed 

compared to their long counterparts. 

Don’t confuse this with the English “long vowels”— these do derive from Old English long 

vowels, but they’re mostly diphthongs now. 

• NASALIZATION: like consonants, vowels can be nasalized. French, for instance, has four nasalized 

vowels [œ ɔ ɛ ɑ] as in **un bon vin blanc.** 

• VOICING: Vowels are normally voiced, but may be unvoiced in particular circumstances; e.g. 

Japanese often devoices vowels between two unvoiced consonants; e.g. the **u** [u] in **kusa** 

‘grass’.An unvoiced vowel may have a fricative (hissing) quality. Phonetically, English **h** can be taken as 

the unvoiced form of the following vowel. 

SEMIVOWELS like **y**, **w** [j w] can be thought of as ultra-short vowels. Fronted [y] has a corresponding 

approximant [ɥ], found in French— e.g. **huile** [ɥil]. 

**Diphthongs** 

A DIPHTHONG is a sequence of two different vowels in the same syllable, as in English **coy, cow, guy** 

/koj kaw gaj/. Phonetically, the vowels are not really distinct; the position of the vocal organs glides 

from one position to the other. 

English has a tendency to diphthongize its closed vowels: e.g. **day** is pronounced [dej], **go** is [gow]. 

Don’t carry this habit over to languages with purer vowels— e.g. French **thé, tôt** are [te, to] not [tej, 

tow]. 

The diphthongs mentioned above end with a semivowel; they can also begin with one, as in **cute** [kjut] 

or Chinese **tiān** ‘heaven’; or you can have a TRIPHTHONG beginning and ending with a semivowel: **xiǎo** 

‘little’. 

A single vowel is sometimes called a MONOPHTHONG, usually in the context of sound change. In 

Southern American English, for instance, /aj/ has monophthongized to /a/. 

**Vowel systems** 

As with the consonants, if you’re inventing a vowel system, don’t just add an exotic vowel or two. 

Invent a vowel system by adding or removing entire classes of vowels. 

Vowel systems vary greatly in complexity. Some of the simplest are those of Quechua (three vowels, **i** 

**u a**) and Spanish (five: **i e a o u**). Simple vowel systems tend to spread out; a Quechua **i**, for instance, 

can sound like English **pit, peat,** or **pet**. Spanish **e** and **o** have open and closed allophones. 

English is fairly rich in vowels, with a dozen or so. French has 16. 

**What makes an good phonetic inventory?** 

People sometimes post phonetic inventories on my board and anxiously await comments. This 

mystifies me... it’s a bit like a painter showing you which colors he intends to use. It’s only a first, 

small step. 

Still, if you’re anxious, here are a few guidelines. 

• Don’t throw in every sound discussed above. New conlangers often throw everything they’ve 

learned into one language— a KITCHEN SINK conlang. 

• It’s a bit tacky to simply use all and only the sounds of English. Or, as in the Standard Fantasy 

Language, English plus **kh**. 

• Think in terms of **features**, not sounds. E.g. add a series of retroflex stops, or nasalized vowels, 

not just one or two new sounds. 

• On the other hand, if your language is aimed at non-conlangers— e.g. it’s the background for a 

novel— your readers are going to ignore exotic sounds anyway. In that case it can be more 

effective to **remove** English sounds than to add new ones. 

**Stress**Don’t forget to give a stress rule. English has unpredictable stress, and if you don’t think about it your 

invented language will tend to work that way too. 

French (lightly) stresses the last syllable. Polish and Quechua always stress the second-to-last 

syllable. Latin has a more complex rule: stress the second-to-last syllable, unless both final syllables 

are short and aren’t separated by two consonants. 

If the rule is absolutely regular, you don’t need to indicate stress orthographically. If it's irregular, 

however, consider explicitly indicating it, as in Spanish: **corazón, porqué.** 

In English, vowels are reduced to more indistinct or centralized forms when unstressed. This is one big 

reason (though not the only one) that English spelling is so difficult. 

**Tone** 

**Tone proper** 

Mandarin syllables have four TONES, or intonation contours: high level; rising; falling-rising, and high 

falling. These tones are parts of the word, and can be used to distinguish words of different meanings: 

**mā** ‘mother’, **má** ‘hemp’, **mǎ ‘**horse’, **mà** ‘curse’. Cantonese and Vietnamese have six tones. 

Tones are often described on a five-point scale, 5 being the highest. The Mandarin tones are 55, 35, 

214, and 51. They may be understood better with diagrams of relative pitch: 

The diacritics are mnemonics for the diagrams. 

Tones are complicated by TONE SANDHI, where neighboring tones influence each other. For example, 

Mandarin’s third tone changes to second before another third tone: **wǒ hěn hǎo** ‘I’m fine’ is 

pronounced **wó hén hǎo**. 

Some answers to questions people often have about tone: 

• Tones are not absolute, but relative to one’s normal pitch— indeed, relative to the intonation of 

the sentence as a whole. 

• Songwriters may or may not try to match the tones of the lyrics to the melody. In Mandarin 

songs tone tends to be ignored; in Cantonese not. 

**Pitch-accent systems** 

If that seems a bit elaborate, you might consider a PITCH-ACCENT system, where intonation contours 

belong to words, not syllables. Japanese and ancient Greek are pitch-accent languages. 

In (standard) Japanese, syllables can be either high or low pitch; each word has a particular ‘melody’ 

or sequence of high and low syllables— e.g. **ikebana** ‘flower arrangement’ has the melody LHLL; 

**sashimi** ‘sliced raw fish’ has LHH; **kokoro** ‘heart’ has LHL. It sounds as if a tone has to be 

remembered for each syllable; but this turns out not to be the case. All you must learn for each word is 

the location of the ‘accent’, the main drop in pitch. Then you apply these three rules: 

• Assign high pitch to all MORAS (= syllables, except that a long vowel is two moras, and a final -n 

or a double consonant takes up a mora too). 

• Change the pitch to low for all moras following the accent. 

• Assign low pitch to the first mora if the second is high. 

Thus for **ike'bana** we have HHHH, then HHLL, then LHLL.**Channels** 

The Amazonian language Pirahã has an extremely simple phonological inventory, with tones. This 

allows it to be communicated by multiple CHANNELS: normal speech, humming, whistling. 

Whispering can be considered a channel too; it can readily be understood though all voicing 

information is lost. 

**Phonological constraints** 

Every language has a series of constraints on what possible words can occur in the language. For 

instance, as an English speaker you know somehow that **blick** and **drass** are possible words, though 

they don’t happen to exist, but **vlim** and **mtar** couldn’t possibly be native English words. 

Designing the PHONOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS (also called PHONOTACTICS) in your language will go a long 

way to giving it its own distinctive flavor. 

Start with a distinctive syllable pattern. For instance, 

• Japanese basically allows only **(C)(y)V(V)(n)**: **Ran-ma, A-ka-ne, Ta-te-wa-ki Ku-noo, Ru-mi-ko** 

**Ta-ka-ha-shi, Go-ji-ra, Too-kyoo, kon-kuu-ru, su-shi**, etc. 

• Mandarin Chinese allows **(C)(i, u)V(w, y, n, ng)**: **wǒ, shì, Měi-guó, rén, wén-yán, chī-fàn, màn-** 

**huà, Wáng, pǔ-tōng-huà,** etc. 

• Quechua allows **(C)V(C)**: **Wall-pa-ku-na sa-ra-ta mi-kuch-kan-ku, ach-ka a-llin ha-tun mo-soq** 

**pu-ka wa-si-kuna**, etc. 

• English goes as far as **(s) + (C) + (r, l, w, y) + (V) + V + (C) + (C) + (C)**: **sprite, thanks-giv-ing**. 

***** ***C and V?* 

**C stands for any consonant, V for any vowel. Parentheses mean that an element is optional. So** 

***(C)V(C)* **means that a syllable must contain a vowel, but can optionally have an initial and/or** 

**final consonant.** 

Try to generalize your constraints. For instance, **m + t** is illegal at the beginning of a word in English. 

We could generalize this to [nasal] + [stop]. The rule against **v + l** generalizes at least to [voiced 

fricative] + [approximant]. 

Some of you will immediately think of **Vladimir**. But notice that that’s a borrowing— new English 

words are still very unlikely to have **vl**. But it’s true that some constraints are harder than others— 

even in borrowings like **psychology** we don’t try to pronounce [ps]— though the French do for 

**psychologie**. 

**Working backwards** 

If you already have a lexicon, you can deduce the phonotactics by examining it and seeing what sort of 

syllables you’ve allowed. 

For instance, if you have a word **bapada**, all the syllables are CV. If you have **strumpsk**, you're 

allowing CCCVCCCC. But try to be more specific: probably you don’t actually allow clusters of any 

three arbitrary consonants. If you have words like **stroi, skrum, prek, blat**, that’s more like 

(s)C(r,l)VC. 

Divide clusters however they sound best to you— e.g. **bastroi** could be **bas-troi** (CVC CCVV) or **ba-** 

**stroi** (CV CCCVV) or even **bast-roi** (CVCC CVV). Be consistent, though. 

Then look at all the syllable types you’re allowing and decide if you really want to allow them all. 

Maybe you decide final CCCC is too much and have to change **strumpsk**.**Assimilation** 

Another process to be aware of is ASSIMILATION. Adjoining consonants tend to migrate to the same 

place of articulation. That’s why Latin **in- + -port = import, ad + simil- = assimil-**. Consonants can 

assimilate in voice to; that’s why our plural **-s** sounds like **z** after a voiced stop, as in **dogs** or **moms**. 

It’s also why Larry Niven’s **klomter**, from **The Integral Trees**, rings false. **m + t** (though not 

impossible) is difficult, since each sound occurs at a different place of articulation; both sounds are 

likely either to shift to the dental position (**klonder**) or the labial (**klomper**). Another possible outcome 

is the insertion of a phonetically intermediate sound: **klompter.** 

**Alien mouths** 

If you’re inventing a language for aliens, you’ll probably want to give them **really different** sounds (if 

they have speech at all, of course). The Marvel Comics solution is to throw in a bunch of apostrophes: 

“This is Empress Nx’id’’ar’ of the planet Bla’no’no!” Larry Niven just violates English phonological 

constraints: **tnuctipun**. We can do better. 

Think about the shape of the mouth of your aliens. Is it really long? That suggests adding a few more 

places of articulation. Perhaps the airstream itself works differently: perhaps they have no nose, and 

therefore can’t produce nasals; or they can’t stop breathing as they talk, so that all their vowels are 

nasal; or the airstream is at a higher velocity, producing higher-pitched sounds and perhaps more 

emphatic consonants. Or perhaps their anatomy allows odd clicks, snaps, and thuds that have become 

phonemes in their languages. 

Several writers have come up with creatures with two vocal tracts, allowing them to pronounce two 

sounds at once, or accompany themselves in two-part harmony. 

Or, how about sounds or syllables that vary in **tonal color**? Meanings might be distinguished by 

whether the voice sounds like a trombone, a violin, a trumpet, or a guitar. 

Suggesting additional sounds is difficult and perhaps tiresome to the reader; an alien ambience can 

also be created by **removing** entire phonetic dimensions. An alien might be unable to produced voiced 

sounds (so he sounts a pit like a Cherman), or, lacking lips, might be stymied by labials (you nust do 

this to de a thentrilocooist, as ooell). 

**Orthography** 

Once you have the sounds of your language down, you’ll want to create an orthography— that is, a 

standard way of representing those sounds in the Roman alphabet. 

You have something very close to this already— your phonemic realization. There’s nothing wrong 

with just using this as your orthography. You have some choices, however. 

Don’t try to be too creative here. For instance, you could represent /a e i o u/ as **ö é ee aw ù**, with the 

accents reversed at the end of the word. An outlandish orthography is probably an attempt to jazz up a 

phonetic system that didn’t turn out to be interestingly different from English. Work on the sounds, 

then find a way to spell them in a straightforward fashion. 

If you’re inventing a language for a fantasy world, take account of how English-speaking readers will 

mangle your beautiful words. Tolkien is the model here: he spelled Quenya as if it were Latin, didn’t 

introduce any really vile spellings, and kindly indicated final **e**’s that must be pronounced. Still, he 

couldn’t resist demanding that **c** and **g** always be hard (I couldn’t either, for Verdurian), whichprobably means that a lot of his names (e.g. **Cirdan**) are commonly mispronounced. 

Marc Okrand, inventing Klingon, had the clever idea of using upper and lower case letters with 

different phonetic values. This has the advantage of doubling the letters available without using 

diacritics, but it’s not very aesthetic and it sure is a tax on memory. 

As an example of different approaches, here’s some alternative transliterations for the same Verdurian 

sentence. 

**Mira rasfolžeca řo fäse meď imočul.** 

**Mira rasfolzheca rho faase medh imochul.** 

**Miɾa ɾasfolʒɛka ʀo fa:sɛ mɛð imotʃul.** 

**A loving mother does not abandon a strayed son.** 

The first is the one I actually use, inspired by Czech orthography— **č** for ch, **š** for sh, etc. The second 

uses digraphs, uglier but more suitable for naïve English speakers and for ASCII applications, such as 

the early web. (In the Unicode era you can generally find any character you want.) The third uses IPA; 

never a bad choice, but sometime awkward (e.g. if you use unusual vowels **and** need to mark tone or 

nasalization). 

Avoid **ee** and **oo** for [i u]; they’re highly marked as English spellings. If people can handle **sushi** they 

can handle **mira.** 

If you’re inventing an **interlanguage**, of course, you shouldn’t worry about English conventions; 

create the most straightforward romanization you can. You’re only asking for trouble, however, if you 

invent new diacritic marks, as the inventor of Esperanto did. 

**Multiple transliterations** 

A sense of variation among the nations of your world can be achieved by using **different** 

**transliteration styles** for each. In my fantasy world, for instance, Verdurian **Ďarcaln** and Barakhinei 

**Dhârkalen** are not pronounced that differently, but the differing orthographies give then a different 

feeling. Surely you’d rather visit civilized Ďarcaln than dark and brooding Dhârkalen? (Tricked you. 

It’s the same place.) 

However, these systems should be motivated— ideally each orthography is a good representation of 

the native writing system (or, for unwritten languages, its phonology). Verdurian and Barakhinei each 

have their own native alphabets, so the differing orthographies suggest this. 

Developing multiple languages, even if they’re just naming languages, can give a map a pleasing 

sense of complexity. For instance, here’s some of the names from the continent of Arcél on Almea: 

**Witsiʔpopok** 

**Smë** 

**Žonyān** 

**Gleŋ** 

**Bélésàɔ** 

**Ȟšanda** 

**Uytai** 

**Rimasača** 

**Siad βo** 

**Praȟmai** 

These ten names represent eight different language families, of widely different phonologies and 

phonotactics. None of the diacritics or unusual characters is decorative; all are straightforward 

representations of the particular languages. 

**Diacritics**Some advice: never use a diacritical mark without giving it a specific meaning, preferably one which 

it retains in all uses. I made this mistake in Verdurian: I used **ö** and **ü** as in German, but **ë** somewhat as 

in Russian (indicating palatalization of the previous consonant), and **ä** as a mere doubling of a. I was 

smarter by the time I got to Cuêzi: the circumflex consistently indicates a low-pitch accent. 

Avoid using **apostrophes** just to make words look foreign or alien. Since apostrophes are used in 

contradictory ways (they represent the glottal stop in Arabic or Hawai’ian, glottalization in Quechua, 

palatalization in romanized Russian, aspiration or a syllable boundary in Chinese, and omitted sounds 

in English, French, and Italian), they end up suggesting nothing at all to the reader. 

**Writing systems** 

The next chapter discusses grammar, but once you have a phonology, you can create an ALPHABET or 

other writing system for your language. If you want to do so now, turn to the section on **Writing** 

**Systems** (p. 216). 

**Acoustic phonetics** 

So far we’ve been concentrating on ARTICULATORY PHONETICS— how sounds are produced. There’s also 

ACOUSTIC PHONETICS— how they are perceived by the ear and brain. To explain this would take a fairly 

long digression into the physics of sound waves, and wouldn’t really improve your conlangs. But a 

couple of facts may be of interest. 

Naively, we may feel that we speak a sound at a particular frequency. Really the sound wave is 

composed of a series of harmonics at various frequencies, with various peaks. The lowest peak is the 

FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY , which we perceive as the pitch of the voice. The higher peaks are called 

FORMANTS. 

• As you raise the pitch of your voice, the fundamental frequency changes, but the formants do 

not. 

• The location of the formants changes for each vowel. 

Here’s a plot of the first two formants (F1 and F2) for a particular speaker, in this case Canadian 

professor Kevin Russell: 

By this time, this picture should remind you of something— namely, the charts of vowels earlier in 

the chapter. So now you know what’s really going on: openness corresponds largely to variation in F1, 

and frontness to F2. 

Russell’s web page (see the Web Resources page) contains a good short introduction to acoustic 

phonetics.
